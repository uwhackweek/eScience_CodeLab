## What is CodeLab?

eScience CodeLab (ECL) is a collaborative workgroup inspired by the ongoing [hackweek events hosted by the eScience Institute at the University of Washington](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/) and the [earthaccess community model](nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/). 

### ECL was created with the following aims:
>1. Create a synthesis of the longer format [hackweek](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/) model and weekly [office hours](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/office-hours/) through ongoing, bi-weekly sessions that foster data science education, community building, and project work with an emphasis on open and reproducible science.
>2. Provide peer-to-peer code review, mentorship, and project management experience to those working this large data sets and emergent cloud storage and open source tools.

</p>

ECL is held on a variable, bi-weekly schedule, depending on the time of year, at the University of Washington's [WRF Data Science Studio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mCw75ykbLPHFnRcg9). See our public calendar for an up to date list of upcoming meetings.

## Event format
The ECL format includes a 15-minute introduction from eScience Institute staff for newcomers, followed by 1.45 hour colloborative working session for attendees. In-person collaboration is preferred, although remote participation is possible for certain projects through Zoom.

To provide an asynchronous collaboration space that exists beyond the workshop, ECL utilizes the disccusion feature available in GitHub. This has two major benefits over Slack and email, specifically, a tighter intergration with the GitHub development architecture, and as a means to preserve historical conversations in a more persistent workspace.
